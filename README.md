Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that help their customers with financial planning. The issue that Artemis financial had was a more secure way to store their data and communications.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

After finding the security vulnerabilities I was able to recognise false positive dependancies and finding the proper solutions to fix any security issues. The importance for Artemis Financial to 
have secure code is to protect themselves and their clients personal information. It is important for all people and companies to have secure code to protect their assets and their handled assets, 
this would be in the intrest of the people and the companies that are handling information. Software security in a company can offer value to clients that may want to use the companies product or
service. In return the company gets more clients and the clients are able to trust the information they give to the software is secure and safe from anyone they do not want to have access. On the
other side, if a company does not have software security then their product or service would not be used by any clients because they know that their information can be accessed by anyone.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most difficult part of the vulnerability assessment for me to learn was the keystore and the certificate generation. I found it difficult to traverse the command prompt to create the certificate,
but the most challenging part for me was understanding what to do with the certificate afterwards. I had forgotten the information we learned from week 5 and forgot to change the server to the keystore
generation in the code. The most helpful part of learning this was when I was struggling to run the program as a spring boot app I found out that spring boot needed to be installed within the eclipse
store. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

After running the dependency checks I learned where the code was vulnerable and how to fix the issues. I think that following the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram helps give a guideline
on the best practices to follow. I think that the maven dependancy check is a very efficient way to find and fix vulnerabilities as the check offers links to best practises and any patches to help
mitigate any vulnerabilities. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To make sure that the code and software was functional was easy, when you run the program in eclipse it will show you any errors and or issues that would make the code not run properly. Making sure
that the code is more secure is best done by having quality code, if your code is of high quality then it is easier to find any issues that are within the code. There are also tools to help you 
make certain the code is secure such as the maven dependency check to show you any dependancies that would make the code vulnerable. To make sure I did not introduce new vulnerabilities after
refactoring the code I ran the dependancy check again and from their filtered out false positives and changed the code where I could again. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The main resource besides the weekly readings for the module was the maven dependancy check, it was very easy to use and to find issues that may cause vulnerabilities. I think that this tool is really
good for security and I will probably continue to use it. The most important resource that I found in the supporting materials throughout this course was the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow
Diagram. This was a good guidline in securing code and if used like a checklist helped me a lot. Both of these tools and just keeping the code clean and readable is the best way to keep code secure
and working, I will be using all of these things in the future. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would use the second project as an example of showing my skills that I have learned. I would show them this because the final project was using all of the information that we learned throughout this
course from the certification to the dependency check, everything we had learned so far was used in this assignment.
